## [0.1.1]
### Changed
* Definition of `Point` class so that `__repr__` function does not need to be specified.
* `get_closest_point` to use `bisect`, speeding up function.

### Added
* Support for file-like operations with `decompress` and `Index.create_index`.
* Comparison method to `Point` class to simplify sort implementation.

## [0.1.0]
### Fixed
* Bug that would not allow you to create a valid modified index if the first point had a non-zero bits property

### Changed
* `create_modified_index` so that it no longer add a point before desired starting position
* `Point` is now a dataclass instead of a named tuple

### Added
* Docstrings and typing throughout

## [0.0.5]

### Added
* Set the window info to all zeros for first point in first point.bits != 0 case. This decreased compressed index size

## [0.0.4]
